<h2>Storyline</h2>
<h3>
An ancient Ring thought lost for centuries has been found, and through a strange twist of fate has been given to a small Hobbit named Frodo. When Gandalf discovers the Ring is in fact the One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron, Frodo must make an epic quest to the Cracks of Doom in order to destroy it. However, he does not go alone. He is joined by Gandalf, Legolas the elf, Gimli the Dwarf, Aragorn, Boromir, and his three Hobbit friends Merry, Pippin, and Samwise. Through mountains, snow, darkness, forests, rivers and plains, facing evil and danger at every corner the Fellowship of the Ring must go. Their quest to destroy the One Ring is the only hope for the end of the Dark Lords reign. Written by Paul Twomey</h3><hr>

<h3>Trivia</h3>
<h4>In the movies, the shards of Narsil are kept at Rivendell, and not reforged and given to Aragorn until midway through the third movie. This is a notable difference from the book, in which Aragorn is already in possession of the broken sword when the Hobbits first meet up with him in Bree. According to Peter Jackson's commentary on the DVD, one of the reasons for this change is because he felt Aragorn would look silly wielding a broken sword.</h4><br>
<h3>Goofs</h3>
<h4>Just after Bilbo's panicked search for the ring in Bag End, the camera pulls away for a long shot, and Bilbo's foot can be seen bouncing on the ground, revealing it to be a rubber prosthetic. </h4><br>
<h3>Quotes</h3>
<h4>[first lines]
Galadriel: The world is changed. I feel it in the water. I feel it in the earth. I smell it in the air. Much that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it. It began with the forging of the Great Rings. Three were given to the Elves, immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. Seven to the Dwarf lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And nine, nine rings were gifted to the race of Men, who, above all else, desire power. But they were, all of them, deceived, for ...</h4>
